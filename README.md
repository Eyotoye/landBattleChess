Thank you for taking the time to review this game project.

1) Game build language
   
   This game was originally developed for a Chinese-speaking audience. 
While the core UI (e.g., menus and the top bar) is in English, parts of the in-game content—including tutorials, certain information panels, and piece names—are presented in Chinese.

   I apologize for the inconvenience; due to the project’s original scope and development history, the language cannot be changed at this stage.

3) English manual
   
   To make the project fully accessible to reviewers, I have prepared a complete **English manual** website: https://eyotoye.github.io/landBattleChess-manual/
